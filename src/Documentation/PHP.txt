PHP4 Installation:
------------------

(This instructions assume, you are using a post 4.3.0-version of PHP)

To compile PHP4, unpack the source and execute "configure" with the 
following opions:

for use with MySQL: 
  $ ./configure --with-apxs=/path/to/apxs --with-mysql=/path/to/mysql

for use with PostgreSQL:
  $ ./configure --with-apxs=/path/to/apxs --with-pgsql=/path/to/pgsql

Then execute

  $ make && make install

from the src directory to compile both, the CLI and the Apache module
version of PHP and install them, as well as the required parts of PEAR. 
This should work without major problems. (Remember: depending on your 
configuration, the `install'-step might require `root'-permissions.)

Further information on PHP, the installation procedure and a language
reference can be found at http://www.php.net.

PHP4 Configuration:
-------------------

At the moment, Koch-Suite needs the following PHP setup:

  [cut]
  magic_quotes_runtime  = Off
  magic_quotes_sybase   = Off
  register_argc_argv    = On	<-- Very important!
  [cut]
