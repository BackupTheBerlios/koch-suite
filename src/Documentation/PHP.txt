Koch-Suite and PHP

PHP4 Installation:
------------------

To compile PHP4, unpack the source and execute "configure" with the 
following opions:

for use with MySQL: 
  (Standalone interpreter:)
  $ ./configure --with-mysql=/path/to/mysql --enable-force-cgi-redirect

  (Apache module:)
  $ ./configure --with-apxs=/path/to/apxs --with-mysql=/path/to/mysql

for use with PostgreSQL:
  (Standalone interpreter:)
  $ ./configure --with-pgsql=/path/to/pgsql --enable-force-cgi-redirect

  (Apache module:)
  $ ./configure --with-apxs=/path/to/apxs --with-pgsql=/path/to/pgsql

Then execute

  $ make && make install

from the src directory to compile and install PHP. This should work
without major problems. (Remember: depending on your configuration, 
the `install'-step might require `root'-permissions.)

Further information on PHP, the installation procedure and a language
reference can be found at http://www.php.net.

PHP4 Configuration:
-------------------

At the moment, Koch-Suite needs the following PHP setup:

  [cut]
  magic_quotes_runtime  = Off
  magic_quotes_sybase   = Off
  register_argc_argv    = On	<-- Very important!
  [cut]

PEAR:
-----

You also need an up-to-date verion of PEAR. PHP-4.0.6's PEAR isn't 
sufficent.  If you do not have a recent version of PHP installed, you 
have to update at least PEAR. To update PEAR, do:

 - change to the directory where the PEAR-files are to be installed:
   # cd /usr/local/lib
 - log into the CVS-repository (password "phpfi"):
   # cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository login
 - fetch a local copy of PEAR:
   # cvs -d :pserver:cvsread@cvs.php.net:/repository co php4/pear
 - adjust the path to PEAR-directory in ../config or in your
   koch-suite.inc, if you have the koch-suite already installed.
