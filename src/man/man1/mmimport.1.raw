.Nd import Mealmaster- and REZKONV-recipes.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
.Op Fl t | Fl -test Op Fl mm
.Op Fl c Ar cat,cat,...
.Op Fl C | Fl -import-new-cat
.Op Fl i | Fl -ignore-unknown-mmext
.Op Fl h | Fl -help
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads recipes from 
.Em STDIN ,
parses them and imports them into the database. The recipes may be in
REZKONV- or Meal-Master-format.
.Pp
Optional paramters are:
.Bl -tag -width "ABITTOLONG"
.It Fl t Fl -test
test the parser.
Do not import the recipe, but rather reformat it into plain ascii.
Output goes to
.Em STDOUT .
.It Fl mm
Reformat parser output to Meal-Master format. This makes sense only in
conjunction with
.Fl -test
.It Fl c Ar cat,cat,...
Add these category-entries to the recipe.
.It Fl C Fl -import-new-cat
Don"t ignore categories which are unknown to the database. 
This is disabled by default.
.It Fl i Fl -ignore-unknown-mmext
Many programs append additional informations - such as the source or date
of recording - to the recipes instruction text in lines starting with a
colon. 
The default is to treat every unknown extension as instruction text. 
This flag makes 
.Nm
ignore such fields and remove them from the recipes.
.It Fl h Fl -help
Show usage and exit.
