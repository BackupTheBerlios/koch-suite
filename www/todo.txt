Todo/Roadmap:
=============

This list gives you an overview of what shall/will be done in
the next release(s). It is neither complete nor can we promise
to follow it strictly.

Planned for 0.8:

  o  Create a pastebox for the web interface which allows easy Copy'N'Paste
     of recipes. [done]
  o  Keep lists of "favorites" (also known as bookmark-list)
  o  mark multiple recipes for printing into a single document

Planned for later releases or bored weekends:

  o  Rezkonv-export
  o  Annotate recipes
  o  Improve the design of the user-interfaces
  o  Save images with the recipes
