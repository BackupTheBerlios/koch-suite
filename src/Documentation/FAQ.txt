1. How can I install Koch-Suite having only FTP and HTTP access
   to my webspace?

I never tried this setting myself. I would start with the following
steps:

i)   create a temporary directory /my/tmp/dir
ii)  Edit ``./config'' and set:
  
     PHP_LIBS        =./include
     SCRIPT_PREFIX   =./commands
     WEB_PREFIX      =./
	  
iii) execute the following commands:

     make
     make install-temp-for-remote DESTDIR=/my/temp/dir

iv)  Move the contents of /my/temp/dir to a subdirectory on your
     webspace via FTP
v)   Notice that $PHP_LIBS/koch-suite.inc contains your access data to the
     database. You have to protect this directory (i.e. deny access via
     .htaccess). See the relevant documentation for information on how
     to do this. Of course it's allways better to place koch-suite.inc
     somewhere outside your DocumentRoot

Please note that I never tried this myself. It should rather work. If not,
please send feedback to me.


2. I get an error message about 'DB.php' not being found.

'DB.php' is part of PHP's PEAR-modules. Normally, these should be
installed (If they aren't follow the instructions in PHP.txt). Search 
for DB.php using 'find' or 'locate' and adjust the variable `PEAR' 
in ../config to the path of this file (or if you have the Koch-Suite 
already installed, adjust it in `koch-suite.inc').


3. The Koch-Suite is quite good, but I'm missing $FEATURE.

There are several ways:

  i)   implement it yourself and send us the patch,
  ii)  send us a detailed description, what you are missing, and ask
       us to implement it.
  iii) use another software which implenets $FEATURE.

There are also some things which probably will never be done, because we
lack time, don't see the use of $FEATURE or would be to hard to do the 
right way. Some of them are:

  i)   shopping lists

Don't ask for these.
