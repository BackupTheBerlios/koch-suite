Answers:

1. How can I install Koch-Suite having only FTP and HTTP access to my webspace?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I never tried this setup myself, but I would start with the following
steps:

i)   create a temporary directory, such as /my/tmp/dir,
ii)  Edit ``./config'' and set:
  
     PHP_LIBS        =./include
     ETC_PREFIX      =./include
     SCRIPT_PREFIX   =./commands
     WEB_PREFIX      =./

iii) execute the following commands:

     make
     make install-temp-for-remote DESTDIR=/my/temp/dir

iv)  Move the contents of /my/temp/dir to a subdirectory on your
     webspace via FTP,
v)   Notice that $ETC_PREFIX/koch-suite.inc contains your access data to the
     database. You have to protect this directory (i.e. deny access via
     .htaccess). See the relevant documentation for your webserver for 
     instructions on how to do this. Of course it's allways better to 
     place koch-suite.inc somewhere completly outside your DocumentRoot.

Please note that I never tried this myself. It should rather work. If not,
please send me feedback.


2. I get an error message about 'DB.php' not being found.
---------------------------------------------------------

'DB.php' is part of PHP's PEAR-modules. Normally, these should be
installed (if they aren't follow the instructions in PHP.txt). Search 
for DB.php using 'find' or 'locate' and adjust the variable `PEAR' 
in ../config to the path of this file (or if you have the Koch-Suite 
already installed, adjust it in `koch-suite.inc').


3. The Koch-Suite is quite good, but I'm missing $FEATURE.
----------------------------------------------------------

There are several ways:

  i)   implement it yourself and send us the patch,
  ii)  send us a detailed description, what you are missing, and ask
       us to implement it. (Donations might readjust the priority on our
       todo list :-))
  iii) use another software which implements $FEATURE.

There are also some things which probably will never be done, because we
lack time, don't see any use for them or they would be to hard to do the 
"right way[tm]". Some of them are:

  i)   shopping lists
  ii)  menu editors

Don't ask for these.


4. What about MS Windows(tm).
-----------------------------

I never tried it my self, I don't use MS Windows(tm). But I received
feedback from one user actually running it on his Windows operating
system.

Maybe this helps you, too:

| Ok,
| 
| The only thing that really won't work is the install script
| I first installed on my linux box, then copied the www folder over to
| WIN/htdocs/koch-suite.. and started hacking the paths :) I imagine one
| could edit/rename the raw files, but I saw this as a faster option for me.
| *everything* is self contained in one dir with this hack, even PEAR.

Using the Cygwin distribution might be another promising approach and has
been described in a mailinglist submission by Gerhard Welte. You can find 
that document here:
