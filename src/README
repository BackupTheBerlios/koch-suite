Koch-Suite
==========

Michael Lestinsky <michael@lestinsky.de>, October 2001
Please see the file `LICENSE' for the license terms, under which you may
use, modify and distribute this package or single parts of it.

The file `INSTALL' contains detailed installation instructions.


What is this?
-------------

Short: a suite of scripts for recipe managment, starting with import
filters for recipes in `Meal-Master'-format (http://home1.gte.net/welliver/), 
as well as some console-tools for exporting into several formats (Plain
Text, MM, LaTeX,...) and finally a complete webinterface.

The goal of the development is to create a system, which complies to the
Un*x-philosophy and makes reuse of code i.e. from a shellskript as simple
as possible. The three main parts, the library, the webinterface and the
console-tools, are different aspects of the same entity.


Requirements:
-------------

To run the webinterface you'll need a running HTTP-daemon (i.e. Apache,
http://httpd.apache.org), PHP4 and a DBMS supported by this package.

The Koch-Suite was tested on:
 - Linux/i386
 - OpenBSD/i386
 - FreeBSD/i386

In any case you will need PHP4 with support for the used DBMS (please see
Documentation/PHP.txt for details).
This scripts where written and tested with PHP-4.0.5 and later, versions
older than PHP-4.0.4 definitely won't work. For the console-tools you have
to install the standalone (a.k.a. cgi-version).

The LaTeX-export uses the `floatflt'-package, which may be found on your
nearest CTAN-archive. To create Postscript you need dvips (which is part
of the TeTeX-distribution). To create PDF documents, you need Ghostscript.
The installation will probe for them and will fall back to the best
possible format if one of those tools is missing. You can manipulate this
behaviour from ETC_PREFIX/koch-suite.inc after the installation.

Further you need a (pretty) current PEAR distribution (later than 4.0.6).
You can update PEAR without updating PHP or use a seperate PEAR installation.
Adjust the path in the `./config'-file propperly.

More informations about PEAR may be found in `Documentation/PHP.txt'.

Status:
-------

The project is quite usable, though it's not finished. The import, export 
and search-functions to the database work very well.

At the moment we have:
 - a tool for database-import of recipes in Meal-Master- or RezKonv-format,
 - export-functions to LaTeX, plain text, Meal-Master-format and HTML,
 - a few prototype-webpages, to implement some fundamental searchfunctions
   to the database and for recipe recording.
 - Multilingualization. Show all pages in the language requested by the
   client. This affects Browsers (`Accept-Language'-header in
   HTTP-requests) and the console-tools (`LC_MESSAGE'- and `LANG'-environment
   variables, LC_MESSAGE has the higher priority)
   The language-modules may be easily created and the interfaces can
   adapted to other languages very simple.
 - a user-managment

You can see the changes to older versions in the file `ChangeLog'.


Todo/'Roadmap':
---------------

 - write documentation,
 - create the possibility to annotate existing recipes,
 - a more comfortable access-control,
 - RezKonv export.


Known Bugs:
-----------

 - Original Meal-Master has a limit of 100 lines per recipe.
   The Koch-Suite ignores this limit. You will receive no warning, when you
   reach this limit.
 - German-English Mischmasch in comments,...
 - Import of recipes with the alternative method to declare
   recipe-headers. (E.g. ("      H    For the sauce"). These headers won't
   be recognised as such and are treated as part of the installation
   instructions therefore. But this kind of headers seems not to be used
   any longer.


Feedback:
---------

Please send us feedback. Bugreports, patches or feature-requests are
welcome. Either send your comments to my email address (as written above)
or join us on our mailinglist. See http://koch-suite.berlios.de for
details.

If you don't like my code: I never said that I've got talent. ;-)


Thanks to:
----------

   and the PostgreSQL-support,
o  Leo Caspari for feedback, error-corrections and extensions,
o  Ulli Fetzer and Ilka Spiess their comments and support while creating
   the Meal-Master- and RezKonv-filters.
