Koch-Suite
==========

Copyright (c) 2002 Michael Lestinsky <michael@lestinsky.de>
Please see the file `LICENSE' for the license terms, under which you may
use, modify and distribute this package or single parts of it.

The file `INSTALL' contains detailed installation instructions.


What is this?
-------------

Short: a suite of scripts for recipe managment, starting with import
filters for recipes in `Meal-Master'-format (http://home1.gte.net/welliver/), 
as well as some console tools for exporting into several formats (Plain
Text, MM, LaTeX,...) and finally a complete web interface.

The goal of the development is to create a system, which complies with the
Un*x-philosophy and makes reuse of code i.e. from a shell script as simple
as possible. The three main parts, the library, the web interface and the
console tools, are different aspects of the same entity.

The functionallity of the web interface and the console tools doesn't
completly correspond, so you'll probably want both parts.


Requirements:
-------------

To run the web interface you'll need a running HTTP-daemon (i.e. Apache,
http://httpd.apache.org), PHP 4.1 and a DBMS supported by this package.

The Koch-Suite was tested on:
 - Linux/i386
 - OpenBSD/i386
 - FreeBSD/i386
 - AIX4.3

In any case you will need PHP4 with support for the used DBMS (please see
Documentation/PHP.txt for details).
These scripts were written and tested with PHP-4.1.1 and later, versions
older than PHP-4.1.0 definitely won't work. For the console tools you have
to install the standalone (a.k.a. cgi) version of PHP.

The LaTeX export uses the `floatflt' package, which may be found on your
nearest CTAN archive. To create Postscript you need dvips (which is part
of the teTeX distribution). To create PDF documents, you need Ghostscript.
The installation will probe for them and will fall back to the best
possible format if one of those tools is missing. You can manipulate this
behaviour from ETC_PREFIX/koch-suite.inc after the installation.

You also need a (pretty) current PEAR distribution (later than 4.0.6).
You can update PEAR without updating PHP or use a seperate PEAR installation.
Adjust the path in the `./config' file propperly.

More information about PEAR may be found in `Documentation/PHP.txt'.

Status:
-------

The project is quite usable, though it's not finished. The import, export 
and search functions to the database work very well.

At the moment we have:
 - a tool for database import of recipes in Meal-Master or RezKonv format,
 - export functions to LaTeX, plain text, Meal-Master format and HTML,
 - a few prototype webpages, to implement some fundamental search functions
   to the database and for recipe recording.
 - Internationalization. Show all pages in the language requested by the
   client. This affects Browsers (`Accept-Language' header in
   HTTP-requests) and the console tools (`LC_MESSAGE'  and `LANG' -environment
   variables, LC_MESSAGE has the higher priority)
   The language modules may be easily created and the interfaces can
   adapted to other languages very simple.
 - user managment

You can see the changes to older versions in the file `ChangeLog'.


Todo/Roadmap:
-------------

This list gives you an overview of what shall/will be done in
the next release(s). It is neither complete nor can we promise
to follow it strictly.

Planned for later releases or bored weekends:

  o  A better system to categorize recipes
  o  Support RezTransfer
  o  Rezkonv-export
  o  Annotate recipes
  o  Keep lists of "favorites" (also known as bookmark-list)
  o  Improve the design of the user-interfaces
  o  Save images with the recipes
  o  spool recipe submissins somewhere for acknowledgement by the
     moderator. 

Please direct your feature-requests to our developers mailinglist,
koch-suite-devel@lists.berlios.de


Known Bugs:
-----------

 - Original Meal-Master has a limit of 100 lines per recipe. Which is IMO
   braindead.  The Koch-Suite ignores this limit. You will receive no 
   warning, when you reach this limit.
 - German-English Mischmasch in comments,...
 - Import of recipes with the alternative method to declare
   recipe-headers. (E.g. ("      H    For the sauce"). These headers won't
   be recognized as such and are treated as part of the preparation
   instructions. But this kind of header seems not to be used
   any longer.


Feedback:
---------

Please send us feedback. Bugreports, patches or feature-requests are
welcome. Either send your comments to my email address (as written above)
or join us on our mailinglist. See http://koch-suite.berlios.de for
details.

If you don't like my code: I never said that I've got talent. ;-)


Thanks to:
----------

o  Everyone who sent me suggestions or patches,
o  Michael Bussmann for the PEARification of the database requests 
   and the PostgreSQL support,
o  Leo Caspari for feedback, error corrections and extensions,
o  Ulli Fetzer and Ilka Spiess their comments and support while creating
   the Meal-Master and RezKonv filters.
