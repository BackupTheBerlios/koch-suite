Todo/Roadmap:
=============

This list gives you an overview of what shall/will be done in
the next release(s). It is neither complete nor can we promise
to follow it strictly.

Planned for 0.8:

  o  Keep lists of "favorites" (also known as bookmark-list)
  o  mark multiple recipes for printing into a single document

Planned for later releases or bored weekends:

  o  Rezkonv-export
  o  Annotate recipes
  o  Improve the design of the user-interfaces
  o  Save images with the recipes

Please direct your feature-requests to our developers mailinglist,
koch-suite-devel@lists.berlios.de
