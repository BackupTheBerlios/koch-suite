Koch-Suite Installation Instructions
====================================

(c) Michael Lestinsky <michael@lestinsky.de>, Oct 2001
The file `LICENSE' contains the license terms under which this package and
every single file from it may be distributed.

If you want to update from an older version of this package, see below.

The following instructions asume that all requirements (see `README') are 
fulfilled. You can find some operating system specific notes at the end of
this document.



Installation:
-------------

The following instructions assume you've got shell access to the computer
you want the Koch-Suite installed on. Please take a look at
`Documentation/FAQ.txt' if this doesn't apply in your case.

 $ tar -xvzf kochsuite-*.tar.gz
   Unpack the sources, if this didn't already happen.

 $ vi config
   Adjust the configuration variables, especially the paths where to
   install this package and the database parameters.

   Set DB_TYPE according to your DBMS. Use "mysql" for MySQL, "pgsql" for
   PostgreSQL. You can find an overview of supported DBMSs in the file 
   `STATUS' in the PEAR/DB directory of your PHP installation 
   (<php-prefix>/share/php/DB).

 $ make

 $ sudo make install

   or:

   $ su root               # (To be root is required only if you set the 
                           # target directories to values you don't have 
                           # write access to.)
   $ make install

To create a DBMS-user -password and -database:

PostgreSQL:
  To create a PostgreSQL database:

  As PostgreSQl-Superuser (or user with "CREATE DATABASE" permissions):
  $ psql -c "CREATE DATABASE dbkoch" template1 bzw.
  $ psql -U<username> -c "CREATE DATABASE dbkoch" template1

  Then as regular user (or the username, you will use to to perform the
  requests, later):
  $ psql [-U<username>] dbkoch <init_db.pgsql

MySQL:
  To create the database and the MySQL-user:

  Invoke a MySQL-shell as MySQL-Superuser (root):
  $ mysql -h DBSERVER -u root -p mysql

  type this commands:

  CREATE DATABASE DBkoch;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DBkoch TO USER@HOST IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

  Replace DBSERVER with the hostname of your database server, USER with
  the name of the account you want to create , PASSWORD respectively and
  HOST with the hostname where the Koch-Suite will be installed. (Please
  note: in MySQL `localhost' and the FQDN of the same computer are not the
  same!)

  Drop back to your normal systems shell and perform

  $ mysql -h DBSERVER -u USER -pPASSWORD DBkoch < init_db.mysql 

  to initialize the database. Replace DBSERVER, USER and PASSWORD
  respectively with the accounts values you just created above.

To create Koch-Suite users:

The Koch-Suite has it's own user managment. This is represented by the table
`usertable' in the database. This will be the usernames and passwords,
you will use to access the webfrontend later. 
To create the users, use the command

  $ ks_passwd PASSWORD

of course you should replace PASSWORD properly. This will echo the
encrypted password and an example SQL-string you can use to insert the
values into your database. Invoke your MySQL-Shell again:

  $ mysql -u USER -p -h DBSERVER DBkoch

and execute the SQL-command (replace "USERNAME" again).

Please note: the crypt()-function used to encrypt the Passwords is
strongly operating system dependant. Especially the Windows(TM)-
Implementation differs from Unix(TM)'s crypt(). This means, you 
can't install the Koch-Suite on a Windows AND on Unix-System and use
the same database. This behaviour is client-independent, using a
Windows client (such as IE) and a Unix Server is completly OK!
MD5-Passwords will be used if your crypt() supports MD5 hashes, 
otherwise the fallback is DES encryption. This is done transparently.



Updating:
---------

A few changes to the database structure were neccessary to add
PostgreSQL-Support. Therefore the old and the new database formats aren't
compatible. If you want to preserve all stored recipes it is probably the
best to dump all the data with (the old!) `rezept'

 $ rezept -mm "" > all.mm 

Or if you have a (post) 0.5 already installed:

 $ rezept -mm -relaxed "" > all.mm

into the file `all.mm' in (relaxed) Mealmaster-format. Delete all tables
and recreate them with `init_db.??sql' from this release as described above. 
Install the new Koch-Suite release and reimport the recipes afterwards
with the new `mmimport'

 $ mmimport < all.mm



Operating System Specific Notes:
--------------------------------

AIX 4.3:
 * you will need Gnu-make (fetch it i.e. from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make)
